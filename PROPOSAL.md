### Final Project Proposal: 
# Conway's Game Of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automation
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 

It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its 
initial state, requiring no further input.

It takes place in a 2D grid of cells each of which is in one of two possible
states: alive or dead.

Every cell interacts with its eight *neighbors*, which are cells horizontally,
vertically, and diagonally adjacent. 

At each step in time each step follows the following rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Background 
My background on this game is having it displayed to me in my first programming class.
I thought it was really interesting but unfortunately it was deemed to complicated to implement
in our introductory course.

Now that I have more experience with coding and I am given the chance to use C++
with a graphics library, I want to finally implement this project.

### Timeline
* Week 1: Create grid of cells, cell class, outlined functions 
and tests. Allow user to initialize a position on board. Create buttons 
that reset board. 

* Week 2: Implement logic of game and more test cases.

* Week 3: Finish implementing logic and finish game.

### Stretch Goals:
* Add button to display different patterns that commonly occur in the game.
* Add a way to speed up and slow down game.
* Look into adding music or sound.
